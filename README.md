## A Java Desktop Application for My University's Call Center Department 🎓☎️

My college was going to be given a grant, or a scholarship, in which if the number of students working at the college exceeds a certain number, 
my college would have received this grant/scholarship. Luckily the call center department for my college was hiring when I heard that jobs had opened up
to work at different departments for the college. Since the call center resided in the main office of the college campus and shared rooms with the web development
team, the manager decided that I could help out the web dev team since I was majoring in CS. Although, in the end, it was decided that I could create an 
application for another manager who wanted to see if I could create an application that could automate data input into an excel sheet. At the time, the call 
center was using excel files as their database and this manager had to manually create different excel files that took up about 3/5's of the their day. 

## About the Program: 📑💾🖥🗂

The application can automatically create and fills out a blank Microsoft Excel sheet or can update an existing Excel sheet. The program receives two text files
from user data input about each employee working the current day and their daily stats at the call center of my university. The program automated a well 
designed template that was constructed by the manager which organizes and color-codes different performance data depending on the employee's stats for the day, 
such as the number of calls taken, the call duration of each customer an employee handled, the number of times an employee switched active status to unavailable, their customer survey ratings, employee schedule hours, and other information. The program can color code different information based on a rating scale that would highlight values with the Excel sheet either red, yellow, and green, respectively for values that did bad, decent, and good for some employee data stats.
