### A Java Desktop Application for My College's Call Center Department 📝🖇

My college had applied or was going to be given a grant or a scholarship in which if the number of students working at the college exceeds a certain number, 
my college would have received this grant/scholarship. Luckily the call center department for my college was hiring when I heard that jobs had opened up
to work at different departments for the college. Since the call center resided in the main office of the college campus and shared rooms with the web development
team, the manager decided that I could help out the web dev team since I was majoring in CS. Although, in the end, it was decided that I could create an 
application for another manager who wanted to see if I could create an application that could automate data input into an excel sheet. At the time, the call 
center was using excel files as their backup database and this manager had to manually created different excel files that took up about 3/5's of the manager's day. 

## About the program: 💾🖥🗂

The application can automatically fill out an existing blank Microsoft Excel sheet, or can create a new Excel sheet. The program receives two text files from 
user data input about each employee working the current day and their stats at the call center at the University of Texas at El Paso. Program automated a well 
designed template that show cased, highlighted, and color-coded different information depending on the employee's stats for the day, such as number of calls 
taken, call duration of each call, number of times the employee switched active status to busy, ratings, employee schedule hours, and other information. The program
can color code different information based on a rating scale that would highlight values with the Excel sheet either red, yellow, and green, respectively for 
values that did bad, decent, and good for employee performances.
