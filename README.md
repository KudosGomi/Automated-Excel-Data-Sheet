## A Java Desktop Application for My University's Call Center Department 🎓☎️

My college was going to be given a grant, or a scholarship, in which if the number of students working at the college exceeds a certain number, 
my college would received this grant or scholarship. Luckily, I was able to apply to the call center department for my college which resided and shared rooms in the same building as the web dev team in which the hiring manager decided that I could help out the web dev team since I was majoring in CS. Although, in the end, it was decided that instead, I could create an application for another manager who wanted to see if I could build an application that could automate data input into  Excel sheets, since at the time, the call center was using Microsoft Excel as a database. This manager had to manually create & modify different Excel files that took up about 3/5's of the their day to create and complete. My program helped automate and reduce the time it took to create these daily Excel data sheets that kept track of the university's employees work performances and stats.

## About the Program: 📑💾🖥🗂

Integrated Apache POI software - the Java API for Microsoft Documents - within my application.
The application can automatically create and fill out a Microsoft Excel sheet or can update an existing Excel sheet. The program receives two files
from user input: a file about the employee's working that current day and the name of an Excel sheet. The program automates a well designed template 
constructed by the manager which organizes and color-codes different employee stats for the day, such as the number of calls taken, the call duration of each customer an employee handled, the number of times an employee switched active status to unavailable, their customer survey ratings, employee schedule hours, 
and other information. The program can color code different information based on a rating scale that would highlight values with the Excel sheet either 
red, yellow, and green, respectively for values that did bad, decent, and good for some employee data stats.
